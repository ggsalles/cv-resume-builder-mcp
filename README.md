## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `uv` installed (for uvx): `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- An MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Kiro, etc.)

### Installation

**Using uvx (recommended - no installation needed!):**

Just configure your MCP client and uvx handles the rest.

**Or install with pip:**
```bash
pip install cv-resume-builder-mcp
```

> **Note:** The configurations below use `uvx` which automatically downloads and runs the latest version from PyPI. If you're developing locally or want to test unreleased features, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for local development setup.

### Configuration

#### For Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cv-resume-builder": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["cv-resume-builder-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AUTHOR_NAME": "your-git-username",
        "REPOS": "default:/absolute/path/to/your-repo"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For multiple repositories:** Change `REPOS` to: `"CompanyA:/path1,CompanyB:/path2,Personal:/path3"`

#### For Kiro IDE

Edit `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cv-resume-builder": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["cv-resume-builder-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AUTHOR_NAME": "your-git-username",
        "REPOS": "default:/absolute/path/to/your-repo"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For multiple repositories:** Change `REPOS` to: `"CompanyA:/path1,CompanyB:/path2,Personal:/path3"`

**Important:** Use absolute paths (no `~`). Get it with `pwd` in your repo directory.

### Restart Your AI Assistant

After configuration, restart Claude Desktop or Kiro to load the MCP server.

### Test It

```
"List available MCP tools"
```

You should see tools like `get_git_log`, `read_cv`, `parse_cv_pdf`, etc.

## Usage Examples

```
"Get my git commits from the last 6 months and suggest CV updates"
```

**With multiple repositories:**
```
"List all my configured repositories"
"Get my commits from CompanyA for the last 3 months"
"Show me all my work across all repositories in the last year"
```

### Parse existing CV
```
"Parse my CV at ~/Documents/resume.pdf"
```

### Generate enhanced CV
```
"Generate an enhanced CV using my existing resume.pdf and recent work from the last 3 months"
```

### Get certifications
```
"Get my Credly badges and add them to my CV"
```

### Analyze commit impact (NEW!)
```
"Analyze my commits from the last month and show me what I actually built"
"Get detailed code changes for commit abc123 to understand the impact"
"Show me the stats for my recent commits to highlight achievements"
```

### Career guidance
```
"Based on my commits, Jira tickets, and certifications, what seniority level am I at?"
"Analyze my work and suggest what skills I need for senior/staff/principal level"
"Review my achievements and help me position myself for a promotion"
"What's missing from my profile to reach the next level?"
```

## Optional Integrations

Add these to your MCP configuration's `env` section:

### Jira (⚠️ Requires Testing)
```json
"JIRA_URL": "https://your-company.atlassian.net",
"JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
"JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token",
"JIRA_USER": "your-email@example.com"
```

Get API token: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens

**Note:** Jira integration is functional but requires more testing across different Jira configurations. Please report any issues!

### Credly (✅ Fully Tested)
```json
"CREDLY_USER_ID": "your-credly-username"
```

Find your username in your Credly profile URL: `https://www.credly.com/users/YOUR-USERNAME`

### LinkedIn (🚧 Not Implemented)
```json
"LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"
```

**Note:** LinkedIn integration is not yet implemented due to authentication requirements. The tool currently only returns your profile URL. For now, manually copy your LinkedIn achievements to `wins.md` file. Contributions welcome!

### CV Formatting
```json
"MAX_BULLETS_PER_EXPERIENCE": "5"
```

## Development

### For End Users (Production)
Use the `uvx` configuration shown above. It automatically downloads the latest stable version from PyPI.

### For Contributors (Local Development)

**Just testing locally?** Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eyaab/cv-resume-builder-mcp.git
cd cv-resume-builder-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Want to contribute changes?** Fork first, then clone your fork:
1. Click "Fork" on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cv-resume-builder-mcp.git
cd cv-resume-builder-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then use the local development configuration from [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) which uses `python3 -m` instead of `uvx`.

### Run Tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Format Code
```bash
black src/
ruff check src/
```
